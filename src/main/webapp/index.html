    The OnePlus 3 is the first OnePlus device to not be part of the invite system,[5] which OnePlus had used for its last three devices to regulate flow with inadequate manufacturing for the inevitable high demand.
    Following some controversy, the OxygenOS 3.2.1 update began rollout on 7 July 2016, with improved RAM management, an alternate sRGB display mode in developer options, and various bug fixes.

   The OnePlus 3 features a new metal back design, similar to that of an HTC M9 or later, with anodised aluminium and curved edges. The device is available in two colors, Graphite (black/gray) and Soft Gold (white/gold, released later in August 2016.[16]) Additionally, users can purchase protective covers in Kevlar or black apricot wood, bamboo, rosewood, and sandstone which takes care of the camera hump and evens it with the phone.
   The device is slightly smaller than its predecessor, the OnePlus 2. It's 2.5mm thinner, 0.9mm shorter, and 0.2mm narrower, but still has the same screen size, at 5.5 inches (140 mm) across diagonally. The display is still 1920Ã—1080 px, comparable to that of the previous two models, but the 3 is the first flagship OnePlus to have an optic AMOLED display. As is typical for most smartphones, the OnePlus 3 features Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection.[17]
